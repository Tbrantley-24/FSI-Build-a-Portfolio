        I was born and raised in San Diego, California. I enjoy hiking, working-out, going to the beach, reading and watching youtube.
        My ideal day would be to start with coffee, a light run, stretching and finishing the day off with dinner and a movie.
        I enjoy spending time with my wife Ola and family. I'm an avid traveler, I love seeing new places and meeting new people.
        My favorite animal is the Tiger, mainly because of its size, strength and pattern.
